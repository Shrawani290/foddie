        <p><h3>Ingridients</h3>
            Here are the ingredients needed:
            
            Besan - Gram flour - is ground chana dal. It is technically different from chickpea flour which is ground chickpeas while besan is fine flour made out of chana dal (Which is in turn split chickpeas without skin)<br>
            Eno - fruit salt is added in the batter for fluffy and light texture.<br>
            Curd - Plain yogurt, reacts and gives airy tiny bubbles. Since this is not fermented batter, curd helps with taste too.<br>
            Lemon juice - Added for tart to balance taste and this reacts as well with the fruit salt or cooking soda.</p>
           <m> <h2>Step-by-step Process</h2>
            Firstly, crush ginger and green chilli to a paste.<br>
                Secondly, take a flat bottomed vessel, (I used the cooker container) grease it generously with oil.<br>


               <u> *MAKE Batter*</u><br>
         After that, take besan in a mixing bowl.<br>
Then add the crushed ginger chilli, water, curd, lemon juice, turmeric, sugar and salt to it.
Mix well furthermore and keep aside.<br>
After that, add the fruit salt to the besan mixture only at the time you are going to steam. Make sure to mix well.
Then, cook this mixture for 10-12 minutes.<br>
Insert a knife to check if its done. It should come out clean.<br>
Keep for 5 minutes to cool down and then invert to a plate. Cut into squares.<br>
Heat oil in a tadka pan. Once hot, add mustard, let it splutter. Then, add asafoetida, chillies to it.<br>
<u>*OPTIONAL STEP*</u><br>
Add Â¼ cup water and 1 tablespoon sugar to the tadka, bring to a boil. After that, spread (pour) it over the dhokla.
And serve it with green chutney. I cut them into squares, you can even cut it like we cut Pizza...

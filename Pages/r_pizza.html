        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3>
            Here are the ingredients needed:
            My easy pizza dough recipe calls for 6 basic ingredients.<br>

Flour – This recipe works well with 100% all-purpose flour or half all-purpose flour and 
<br>half white whole wheat. Read more about the best flour to use in pizza dough in the callout<br> below!<br>
Active dry yeast – It helps the dough rise, yielding a nice and puffy crust. You can also use <br>instant yeast in this recipe, though I still recommend proofing it to guarantee that it’s fresh.<br>
Water – For moisture. Make sure that it’s warm, but not too hot, to help activate the yeast.<br>
Sugar – It feeds the yeast, helping the dough rise. Maple syrup or honey works well here too.<br>
Sea salt – It’s essential for a flavorful crust.<br>
And extra-virgin olive oil – For richness, moisture, and flavor.<br>

           <m> <h2>Step-by-step Process</h2>
            Firstly, crush ginger and green chilli to a paste.<br>
                Secondly, take a flat bottomed vessel, (I used the cooker container) grease it generously with oil.<br>


               <u> *MAKE Batter*</u><br>
         After that, take besan in a mixing bowl.<br>
Then add the crushed ginger chilli, water, curd, lemon juice, turmeric, sugar and salt to it.
Mix well furthermore and keep aside.<br>
After that, add the fruit salt to the besan mixture only at the time you are going to steam. Make sure to mix well.
Then, cook this mixture for 10-12 minutes.<br>
Insert a knife to check if its done. It should come out clean.<br>
Keep for 5 minutes to cool down and then invert to a plate. Cut into squares.<br>
Heat oil in a tadka pan. Once hot, add mustard, let it splutter. Then, add asafoetida, chillies to it.<br>
<u>*OPTIONAL STEP*</u><br>
Add ¼ cup water and 1 tablespoon sugar to the tadka, bring to a boil. After that, spread (pour) it over the dhokla.
And serve it with green chutney. I cut them into squares, you can even cut it like we cut Pizza...
